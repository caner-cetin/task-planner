This is a small backend where students can sign up and plan their tasks.

- [x] User can sign up, login and see anything about themselves.
- [x] User can create, update, delete tasks.
- [x] User can see all tasks.
- [x] User can see tasks by date.
- [x] User can see tasks by or within a year, month, week, or day without sending a special request from frontend.
- [x] User can update plan deadlines.
- [x] Prevention for creating tasks that would clash with another plans execution time.

Postman collection is included in the root directory. See [this JSON file.](./Task%20Planner.postman_collection.json) Maybe I will implement frontend for this project in the future, but for now, it is just a backend.

Commit history is deleted from the repository because this project belonged to a case study for a company. It wouldnt be nice to show their name in the commit history. Still having respect for the company, I decided to delete the commit history.
